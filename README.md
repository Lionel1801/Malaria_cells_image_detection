# Malaria_cells_image_detection
This is a binary classification of parasitized(infected cells) and uninfected cells. I used Convolutional Neural Networks to detect parasitized cells from uninfected cells. I furthermore defined the performance of the algorithm using a confusion matrix.

The process involved the loading of the data in a splitted training and validation datasets, defining the model architecture, model summary, training and validating the model, visualizing the learning curve, confusion matrix to define performance, Interpretation.
